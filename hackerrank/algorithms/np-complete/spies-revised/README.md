# spies-revised challenge

I enjoyed [the challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/spies-revised/problem) and I don't want to ruin it for you. So you will not find my final code here. The final code is based on the [min-conflicts algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min-conflicts_algorithm) algorithm and runs for an hour on my laptop to find a solution for N=999.

File `spies-revised.c` contains a version based on a simple hill climber. It is not a correct solution since it turns unacceptably slow with any N bigger than 100 and it always sticks to a local optima failing to find a solution.

File `spies-revised.c.asc` contains the final code encrypted with `gpg`.

File `solution.py` contains a ready-to-upload solution for N=777 as a proof.
